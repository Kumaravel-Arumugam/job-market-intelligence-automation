# 📊 System Outputs – Job Market Intelligence Automation

This document presents **actual outputs** generated by the Job Market Intelligence Automation system.

All outputs shown below are derived from real job postings and processed through deterministic, rule-based analytics.  
This is not mock data or simulated output.

---

## ⚙️ Output Configuration Context (Important)

- **Default System Configuration (MVP):**  
  The workflow is configured to collect **up to 60 job postings per role**.  
  This limit exists to ensure predictable execution, cost control, and stability during regular usage.

- **Validation Test Run (Shown Below):**  
  For validation and analytics stress-testing, the collection limit was **temporarily increased to 1000 job postings**.

- **Deduplication Result:**  
  From the 1000 collected postings, the system identified **782 unique job postings** after applying deterministic deduplication logic.

> This validates that the system can scale beyond MVP limits while maintaining data quality and analytical integrity.

## 🧠 AI Usage Disclosure (Transparency)

- **Language Model Used:** Granite 3B (3-billion-parameter model)  
- **Runtime:** Ollama (local inference)

**Scope of AI Usage:**
- AI is used **only to enrich and structure textual summaries** in the final report.
- AI does **not** influence data collection, aggregation, filtering, or calculations.

**Deterministic (Non-AI) Components:**
- Job collection and pagination  
- Deduplication of job postings  
- Skill frequency computation  
- Experience parsing and binning  
- Consistency and similarity scoring  
- Chart generation and visualization logic  

> All charts, metrics, and numerical outputs are produced using deterministic, pre-configured logic.  
> AI does not modify or generate analytical results or visualizations.
